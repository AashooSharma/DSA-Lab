## ‚ö° How To Contribute

Contributions are highly encouraged! üõ†Ô∏è  
If you're new to GitHub or contributing to open-source projects, check out the [**Contribution_Helper.md**](./Contribution_Helper.md) for a step-by-step guide on how to:

- Clone the repository
- Create a new branch
- Make modifications or add new solutions
- Commit your changes
- Send a pull request

### üìú **Important Contribution Rules:**

- **No pushing directly to the main branch.**  
  All contributions must be made through branches with descriptive names like your class roll number or name (e.g., `pce24cs807`, `pce23cs150`, `abhisheksharma`).
- Follow the professional practices of version control. Learn how to work in teams and contribute efficiently to large projects.

For a detailed explanation on how to work with GitHub in a team, refer to the [Contribution_Helper.md](./Contribution_Helper.md).
